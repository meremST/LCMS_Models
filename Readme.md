This repository contains verifiable models and associated material for our System-on-Chip (SoC) Life Cycle Management System (LCMS) case study.
Two distinct aspects of this LCMS are modeled:
* Its cryptographic protocol, using [VerifPal](https://verifpal.com/).
* Its architecture model, using [AnimUML](https://github.com/fjouault/AnimUML).

# Cryptographic Protocol Model

The cryptographic protocol was first modeled as semi-formal UML sequence diagrams before being formalized using VerifPal.

## Semi-formal Protocol Model

### Main Sequence Diagram

This sequence diagram contains references to sub-diagrams that are given below.

### Provisioning

### ConfigurationModification

## Verifiable Protocol Model

The full VerifPal model is available in [LCMS_Protocol_Model.vp](LCMS_Protocol_Model.vp).

VerifPal is a software tool for verifying the security of cryptographic protocols.
It is available for Windows and Linux from [this page](https://verifpal.com/software/).

In order to verify the VerifPal model, run the following command:

```
./verifpal verify path/to/LCMS_Protocol_Model.vp
```
With "path/to" the path to the `LCMS_Protocol_Model.vp` file.

Protocol verification takes several hours.

VerifPal can also generate the following visual representation thanks to its [visual studio extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=symbolicsoft.verifpal):

in order to browse the model, animate it, or even verify it.
You may check AnimUML's [documentation](https://animuml20220518.kher.nl/doc.html) and [tutorial](https://animuml20220518.kher.nl/tutorial.html) for more information on using it.

The model analysis menu (left-hand side) makes it possible to see watch expressions (with their current values), and LTL properties.
Additionally, it can be used to perform in-browser analysis, such as state space exploration.
LTL model checking requires connecting to the [OBP2](http://www.obpcdl.org/) model checker.
This can be achieved by opening "Connect to external analysis tool", and clicking the `Ok` button.
The `VERIFY_LTL_PROPERTY` action that then appears can be used to verify a single property (selected with a drop-down list) at a time.

Note that LTL model checking can take several minutes without visible feedback (this is a known issue).
Moreover, because the model checker is in the cloud while the model is executed in your browser, internet connection latency can be an issue.
Using a local installation of OBP2 significantly decreases verification time, but this is not publicly available at this time.

Alternatively, you may simply have a look at the diagrams generated by AnimUML, which are inlined below.
